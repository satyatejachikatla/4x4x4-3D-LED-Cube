# 4x4x4 3D LED Cube

## Requirements

* Led (Blue looks good)
* Resistors (resistance changes with the LED choosen)
* BC547 Transistors
* 74HC595 Decoders

* Jumper wires (Male-Male , Male-Female)
* Solid Core Hookup wires
* German silver wires

* Soldering equipment

* 2 Breadboards
* Thermocol sheet

* Any Controller of Choise to code

## Manufacturing

### 1. LEDs and Wires

* Check the working of LEDs by attaching resistor to led the to powersupply (3.3V or 5V).
* Stright the German silver wire and cut to length of the Grid Size.


### 2. Setup for Layer

* Print out a square grid of 4x4 on a piece of paper and secure it with thermocol sheet.
* Make holes in the sheet where the grid lines intersect.

### 3. Layer Manufacturing

* Place the LEDs in the holes secuely in a proper pattern.
* Bend the cathod of all the LEDs to one direction.
* Place a German silver wire on a Horizontal Line of cathods and solder to all of them.
* Do it to all the Horizontal Lines.
* Connect Side Veritcally to connect all Horizontal Lines using two German silver wires.
* Manufacture such 4 layers.

### 4. Combining Layers

* 

### 5. Soldering Wires

* For each layer attach a German silver wire
* Also attach a German silver wire on the bottom for all the LED vertical lines.
* Connect them to a Zero PCB and attach a Female adapter.
